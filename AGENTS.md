# Code style and structure

- Write concise, technical TypeScript code with accurate examples.
- Use functional and declarative programming patterns.
- Prefer iteration and modularization over code duplication.
- Use descriptive variable names with auxiliary verbs (e.g., isLoading, hasError).
- Structure files: constants, types, exported functions, non-exported functions.
- Avoid magic strings and numbers; define constants.
- Use camelCase for files and directories (e.g., modules/shiftOffers.ts).
- When declaring functions, use the `function` keyword, not `const`.
- Prefer data immutability.
- Use Conventional Commits 1.0 for commit messages.

# Error handling and validation

- Sanitize user input.
- Handle errors and edge cases at the beginning of functions.
- Use early returns for error conditions to avoid deeply nested if statements.
- Place the happy path last in the function for improved readability.
- Avoid unnecessary else statements; use the if-return pattern instead.
- Use guard clauses to handle preconditions and invalid states early.
- Implement proper error logging and user-friendly error messages.
- Favor `@clipboard-health/util-ts`'s `Either` type for expected errors instead of `try`/`catch`.

# Testing

- Follow the Arrange-Act-Assert convention for tests with newlines between each section.
- Name test variables using the `mockX`, `input`, `expected`, `actual` convention.
- Aim for high test coverage, writing both positive and negative test cases.
- Prefer `it.each` for multiple test cases.
- Avoid conditional logic in tests.

# TypeScript usage

- Use strict-mode TypeScript for all code; prefer interfaces over types.
- Avoid enums; use const maps instead.
- Strive for precise types. Look for type definitions in the codebase and create your own if none exist.
- Avoid using type assertions like `as` or `!` unless absolutely necessary.
- Use the `unknown` type instead of `any` when the type is truly unknown.
- Use an object to pass multiple function params and to return results.
- Leverage union types, intersection types, and conditional types for complex type definitions.
- Use mapped types and utility types (e.g., `Partial<T>`, `Pick<T>`, `Omit<T>`) to transform existing types.
- Implement generic types to create reusable, flexible type definitions.
- Utilize the `keyof` operator and index access types for dynamic property access.
- Implement discriminated unions for type-safe handling of different object shapes where appropriate.
- Use the `infer` keyword in conditional types for type inference.
- Leverage `readonly` properties for function parameter immutability.
- Prefer narrow types whenever possible with `as const` assertions, `typeof`, `instanceof`, `satisfies`, and custom type guards.
- Implement exhaustiveness checking using `never`.
