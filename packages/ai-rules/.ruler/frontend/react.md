# React

- Destructure props in function body (improves readability and prop documentation)
- Prefer inline JSX over extracted variables
- Use custom hooks to encapsulate and reuse stateful logic
- Use Zod for request/response schemas in data-fetching hooks
- Use react-hook-form with Zod resolver for forms
- Use date-fns for date operations
