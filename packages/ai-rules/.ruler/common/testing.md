# Testing

- Follow the Arrange-Act-Assert convention for tests with newlines between each section.
- Name test variables using the `mockX`, `input`, `expected`, `actual` convention.
- Aim for high test coverage, writing both positive and negative test cases.
- Prefer `it.each` for multiple test cases.
- Avoid conditional logic in tests.
